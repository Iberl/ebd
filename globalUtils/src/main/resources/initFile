#Initialisation file for ETCS at EBD
#Lines that start with # are comments
#This file contains startup information about the trains for the ETCS program.
#Every line is a train.
#Every train is described by multiple variables of type in, string and boolean:

#etcsID (int): The etcs ID of the train, has to be unique.

#trainConfigID (int): The ID of the train in the TrainConfig Tool (192 if no Tool is used).

#infrastructureID (int): The ID of the train on the EBD infrastructure, has to be unique.

#trainScheduleID (String): The ID of the train in the EBD train schedule, currently not used, has to be unique.

#rbcID (int): The RBC the train connects too during start up.

#starting balise group (int): The balise group the train starts at, used by the TMS, has to be unique.

#starting movement direction: The direction of train movement in relation to the starting balise. If the balise is crossed in nominal direction, then true, else false.

#starting track (String): The track ID the train is placed on the EBD infrastructure, used by the EBD infrastructure, has to be unique.

#starting direction (boolean): !!Placeholder!! Starting Orientation of the train in relation to the starting balise, should always be true

#starting increment (int): The distance from the starting balise in [m].

#Every variable is divided by a ; and any number of white spaces (" "). Variables are not allowed to contain white spaces.
